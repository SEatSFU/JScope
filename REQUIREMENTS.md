## Requirements

A Dockerfile is provided to run the project in an isolated container along with all of its dependencies.
The only requirement is having Docker installed on your machine.
* If running on a machine with Apple silicon (M1, M2, etc.), 
slight changes to the `docker build` and `docker run` commands are needed, which are explained in the `INSTALL.md` file.
